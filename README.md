Implementation for 100 code challenge.

# Result: 16

To solve this challenge I was made following steps:

- Get image
- Get all pixels and determine the color of each of them
- Iterate each one and draw at the same point green pixel if this one meets the "100"
- Increment counter to calculate number of pixels
- Save image and return number of points 

# HTML + JS 

Get image as base64 to avoid using the server and make this one as canvas to get pixels and draw new image with red and green points.


# Python

Same implementation using Python.
